# my-awesome-nuxt-app

> My splendiferous Nuxt.js project

I built this app by watching Maximilian Schwarzm√ºllers video [Nuxt.js - Introduction by Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nteDXuqBfn0)

It lists Gopher Stickers from [https://gopherswag.com/](https://gopherswag.com/) ... not really. I'm just faking a request but the images are from that site.
